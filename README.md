## Syllabus
### Goal of This Class
The goal of this class is to teach “programming literacy”: the ability to read and write programs. By the end of this semester, you should be able to break down projects and problems into programmable chunks, communicate ideas in an algorithmic manner, and using code to bring your projects to life.

### Grading Policy
I expect you to regularly demonstrate understanding of topics covered in class and how to apply them. Assignments need not follow the letter of the order, as long as they demonstrate mastery of the targeted technologies and have comparable or greater complexity. Many project subjects will be based off original ideas. This is to encourage play and experimentation.

Assignments that demonstrate appropriate effort but do not run or do not meet criteria will be returned with notes for improvement and an appropriate extension. Extensions can be given without penalty if sufficient work can be demonstrated.

### Fine Print
[Academic Integrity](http://policies.tcnj.edu/policies/digest.php?docId=7642)
 - Please do not plagiarize.
 - If you’d like help on an assignment, feel free to team up with another student and bring it to my attention.
 - Naturally, I’ll expect a higher level of quality from projects involving multiple people.
### Absence and Attendance
 - Missing more than three classes is going to start to impact your grade.
### Final Examination-Evaluation-Reading Days
 - We must have a final something
 - It has to count for 15% - 50% of your final grade, currently 25%
### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
 - If you’re registered with Office of Differing Abilities Services, please bring it to my attention to discuss any necessary accommodations.
 
###Official Course Description
A first course in computing languages for interactive multimedia. Students learn how to “talk” to a computer using programming, in the process creating custom software, visualizations, interactive installations and games. Through intensive laboratory experience, students learn the fundamentals of programming, including data types, algorithms, events, control structures, functions, heuristics, logic, interaction and abstraction. Students also learn to work with a range methods for input and output, including bitmap and vector graphics, sound, animation, video and sensors.
