# 3 Basic Drawing

## 3.1 Drawing on a grid

This is the canvas, where would you imagine the origin to be? If I asked you to plot (0, 0) on this graph, where would you put it?

Let's break it down. This will feel familiar from algebra or calculus.

The X-axis the horizontal axis that goes left to right. The Y-axis is the vertical axis that goes up and down.

A **coordinate** a location on the grid as specified by pair of numbers: an X-value (distance along the X-axis away from the origin) and a Y-value.

The correct answer is that **the origin goes in the top left** corner in programming.

This is inverted from traditional math graphs, which has the origin in the *bottom* left so that the larger a value is, the higher it goes. It also goes against some creative environments that put the origin in the center.

One way you can think of the Y-axis in programming is as a submarine depth. The larger the Y value of a coordinate, the farther from the top it is. This has to do with the way computers store information and will be clearer when we talk about arrays later this semester.

For example, let's consider the coordinates (80, 150) and try to place this point on the grid. We would normally call 80 the **x-coordinate** since it specifies the horizontal position along the X-axis and 150 the **y-coordinate** since it specifies the same along the vertical Y-axis. The larger the x-coordinate, the farther left a point. The larger the y-coordinate, the farther down the canvas. In every coordinate pairing, **x is always first, followed by y**. This goes for all paired measurements in code (like width and height), they always go horizontal first, then vertical.
