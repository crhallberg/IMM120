## 0.0.5 Minute Surveys

At the end of every class you will be asked to fill out a short one page survey called a minute survey. It is designed to literally take a minute. While they are not graded, they are used for attendance and will often contain a few questions about the material for the class.

The more important aspect of these surveys is feedback. There will always be a spot for you to request a meeting, ask a question, express confusion, or tell me what I can do better next week.
