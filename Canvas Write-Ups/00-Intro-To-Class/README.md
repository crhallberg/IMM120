## 0.2 Grades

The distribution of grades for this class is as follows:

- 15% for attendance

After class you will get a chance to weigh in on this via your first Minute Survey, which we'll get to later.

## 0.5 Schedule

The class consists of 14 classes and a final exam period. See the [schedule](../README.md) on the front page of this repository.


## 0.6 Minute Surveys

At the end of every class you will be asked to fill out a short one page survey called a minute survey (or minute quiz or minute sheet, I may not call it the same thing every time. It is designed to literally take a minute. While they are not graded, they are used for attendance and will often contain a few questions about the material for the class.

The more important aspect of these surveys is feedback. There will always be a spot for you to request a meeting, ask a question, express confusion, or tell me what I can do better next week.
